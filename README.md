This script uses the Flask library to create a REST API with a single endpoint, /gpt3, that allows you to generate text using the OpenAI GPT-3 model. The endpoint accepts POST requests with a JSON body that contains the prompt for the text you want to generate. The endpoint returns a JSON response that contains the generated text.

You can run this script locally on your computer by opening a terminal window, navigating to the folder where the script is located, and running the command python app.py. This will start the web server and it will be listening for requests on http://localhost:8080/gpt3

Make sure to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your own API key that you can get by creating an account in https://beta.openai.com/signup/.

Also, this is just a basic example and you may need to modify the code to suit your specific requirements and use case.
